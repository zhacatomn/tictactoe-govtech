# Tic Tac Toe App for GovTech Assessment

## Set Up

First, clone this repository locally, and navigate to the folder on your command line.
Next, we need to turn on the server:

```
$ cd server
$ npm install // You only need to do this if it's your first time running the application
$ npm start
```

On a **separate** command line, in the folder on the repository, we now need to turn on the client:

```
$ cd client
$ npm install // You only need to do this if it's your first time running the application
$ npm start
```

Now you should be able to access the app on `http://localhost:3000/`!
